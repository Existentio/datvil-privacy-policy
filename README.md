This privacy policy applies to the **Datvil** mobile application (hereby referred to as the **"Application"**) for mobile devices that was created by **Georgii Tselkovskii** (hereby referred to as the **"Service Provider"**) as a free service. This service is intended for use **“AS IS”**.

## Information Collection and Use

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include, but is not limited to:

- Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
- The pages/screens of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages
- The total time spent in the Application
- The operating system and version you use on your mobile device

The Application itself does **not** gather precise GPS information about the location of your mobile device.

You may also provide personally identifiable information directly within the Application, including but not limited to:

- Profile information (such as name or nickname, age, bio, interests, relationship goals, and other details you choose to share)
- Photos and other media you upload to your profile
- City or approximate location you choose to display
- Information about your interactions in the app (likes, matches, messages, and other social activity)

This information is used to operate the Application and provide its core dating and social features, such as showing you other users, enabling chat, and helping you find people in or near your selected city.
Photos that you upload for dream-type image search or compatibility matching may be processed using artificial intelligence technologies to enable image-based search and recommendation features.

In order to provide image search and AI-based matching functionality, certain user-provided content (including uploaded photos and related matching preferences) may be securely transmitted to third-party service providers for processing.

## Location and Geolocation Data

The Application does not access your precise GPS location without your permission. However, the Application may process **approximate** location information you provide (e.g. your city or region) and may use certain technical information (such as IP address) to derive a rough geographic area.

The Service Provider may use this approximate location information in the following ways:

- **Geolocation Services** – To show you users near your chosen city or region and to provide localized content or recommendations.
- **Analytics and Improvements** – Aggregated and anonymized location data helps the Service Provider analyze user behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall performance and functionality of the Application.
- **Third-Party Services** – Periodically, anonymized and aggregated location-related data may be transmitted to external services that assist in enhancing the Application and optimizing its features.

## User Communications and Content

The Application allows you to exchange messages and other content (such as emojis, text, or profile information) with other users.

- Your messages are processed to deliver them to your conversation partners and to maintain the chat history as part of the Application’s normal operation.
- The Service Provider does not read your private conversations on a regular basis, but may access them in limited cases where required by law, to investigate abuse, or to ensure the safety and integrity of the service.

## Use of Information

The Service Provider may use the information you provide, and the information automatically collected, for purposes including:
